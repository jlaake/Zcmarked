Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demographic models describe the factors that affect population size including
 survival, reproduction and movements of individuals into and out of a populatio
n and are a cornerstone of population analysis (Johnson 1994).
 For pinnipeds which are long-lived, have expansive ranges, and spend most
 of their lives at sea, demographic studies that span the lifetime of individual
s are rare (but see Testa and Siniff 1987, Huber et al.
 1991, Hernández-Camacho et al.
 2008).
 Consequently, population analysis is often based on trends in indices such
 as annual counts of pups or adults but the causal factors producing the
 trends are often unknown (Lowry et al.
 1992, Fritz and Stinchcomb 2005, Shaughnessy et al.
 2005, Towell et al.
 2006).
 The annual variation in survival and natality rates derived from demographic
 studies can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms for population
 trends, such as age or sex-specific responses to population size, environmental
 changes or disease (Eberhardt and Siniff 1977, Fowler 1980, Fowler and
 Siniff 1991, Jorgenson et al.
 1997).
 Estimates of survival and natality can also be used to develop correction
 factors for population indices and to develop age-structured population
 models to estimate population growth rates (Wickens and York 1997, Holmes
 et al.
 2007).
 For pinnipeds, estimates of life history parameters can be obtained from
 cross-sectional samples from animals collected for research, during subsistence
 harvests, or incidental to fisheries (Lander 1981, Pitcher and Calkins
 1981, Boyd 1985, York 1994, Bester 1995, Hammill and Gosselin 1995, Lima
 and Páez 1995) but these data are often biased toward specific sex or age
 classes.
 Mark-recapture studies of uniquely marked live pinnipeds offer an alternative
 and often less biased method of estimating life history parameters and
 have become more common in recent years (e.g.
 Testa and Siniff 1987, Le Boeuf and Reiter 1988, Huber et al.
 1991, Boyd et al.
 1995, Schwarz and Stobo 2000, Raum-Suryan et al.
 2002, Beaupaulet et al.
 2006, McIntosh 2007, Hernández-Camacho et al.
 2008).

\begin_layout Standard
California sea lions (
\shape italic
Zalophus californianus
\shape default
) are an abundant pinniped with an expansive range along the Pacific coast
 of North America, from Mexico to southeast Alaska.
 But each summer, most of the population returns to the breeding areas for
 the reproductive season, offering a unique opportunity to observe all the
 age-classes and both sexes and to conduct longitudinal studies of uniquely
 marked individuals.
 The primary breeding areas are the California Channel Islands off the coast
 of California and offshore islands of Baja California, Mexico.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The U.S.
 California sea lion population is the largest breeding population in the
 species range.
 The population breeds in the California Channel Islands and feeds in the
 California Current ecosystem.
 The population has been increasing up to 5

 per year since sea lions were protected by the U.S.
 Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972 (Carretta et al.
 2007).
 The population is currently estimated at 240,000 to 280,000 animals (Caretta
 et al.
 2007).
 During the period of population growth, the California Current ecosystem
 was predominately in a warm oceanographic regime that began in 1977 and
 resulted in two decades of low productivity (Hayward 1997, Goericke et
 al.
 2004).
 This period was followed by a cold regime beginning in 1999 characterized
 by high productivity (Goericke et al.
 2004) that continued into 2007 (McClatchie et al.
 2008).
 Within these large-scale oceanographic events, El Niño Southern Oscillation
 (ENSO) events occurred in 1982-1983 (CalCOFI 1984), 1992-1993 (Lynn et
 al.
 1995), 1997-1998 (Lynn et al.
 1998), and 2002-2003 (Venrick et al.
 2003) that intensified the low productivity of the ecosystem for one to
 two years.
 Although the large-scale and ENSO events were associated with large declines
 in the abundance of marine species at most trophic levels (Veit et al.
 1996, Goericke et al.
 2004), the sea lion population responded only to the ENSO events with significa
nt temporary declines in pup production and pup survival during each event
 (Francis and Heath 1991, DeLong et al.
 1991, Boness et al.
 1991, DeLong and Melin 2000, Melin 2002, Caretta et al.
 2007).
 The ENSO reduced prey availability for California sea lions, particularly
 for females with dependent pups that cannot migrate to better foraging
 areas, and resulted in low natality and low survival of pups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to environmental events that occurred during the period of populatio
n growth, the California sea lion population also experienced occurrences
 of leptospirosis disease (Colagross-Schouten et al.
 2002, Norman et al.
 2008), hookworm disease (Lyons et al.
 1996, Lyons et al.
 2001) and domic acid poisoning from a naturally occurring toxin (Gulland
 et al.
 2002).
 Environmental and disease events may influence the dynamics of a population
 long after the immediate effects are observed in population trends (Jorgenson
 et al.
 1997).
 Demographic studies allow the age and sex-specific effects of such events
 to be described and modeled for effects on the population growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been no demographic studies to estimate the life history parameters
 of California sea lions breeding in the California Channel Islands, such
 as age at first reproduction, age-specific natality and sex and age-specific
 survival rates.
 Without these basic measurements, Lowry et al.
 (1992) used survival and natality rates of the northern fur seal (
\shape italic
Callorhinus ursinus
\shape default
) to develop a model of California sea lion population growth based upon
 trends in pup production.
 However, a species-specific demographic model is needed to better understand
 factors influencing California sea lion population trends.
 Recently Hernández-Camacho et al.
 (2008) reported sex- and age-specific survival rates for branded California
 sea lions from a mark-recapture study in the Gulf of California, Mexico.
 From a relatively small dataset, they were able to describe general patterns
 in survival but were limited to only 3 age classes due to small sample
 sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish baseline measurements of sex and age-specific survival rates
 of California sea lions in the Channel Islands, we initiated a long-term
 branding and resighting study at San Miguel Island, California.
 From 1987 to 2009, we branded a cohort of 4-5 month old pups and resighted
 branded sea lions during subsequent reproductive seasons through 2009.
 Using Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models for capture-recapture data, we evaluated
 possible year, sex, age and environmental effects on survival.
 The dynamic nature of the 22 year period with population growth, large-scale
 ecosystem shifts, El Niño and disease events provided both opportunity
 and challenges in evaluating factors that may affect survival.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
San Miguel Island (SMI) (34.03

\begin_inset Formula $^{\mathrm{o}}$

 W) is one of the California Channel Islands located 46 km off the California
 coast (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig1"

\end_inset

).
 California sea lions use SMI for pupping, breeding and hauling-out.
 Reproductive and hauling sites range from small, rocky coves to large,
 expansive sandy beaches.
 Most reproduction occurs on the west end of the island.
 Hauling sites on the remainder of the island are used primarily by juveniles
 and non-reproductive males especially during the reproductive season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All age, sex, and reproductive classes of California sea lions inhabit SMI
 at various times throughout the year, but the greatest number of animals
 at the colony occurs between late May and early August for the reproductive
 season (Peterson and Bartholomew 1967, Odell 1981, Heath 1989).
 Most adult females are non-migratory and visit the colony regularly throughout
 the year but males tend to disperse from the colony during the winter,
 returning to the colony in late May for breeding.
 California sea lions have distinct pupping and breeding periods within
 the reproductive season.
 Pupping occurs over a six week period from late May to early July.
 California sea lion females give birth to a single pup and remain in constant
 attendance of the pup for 5 to 8 d.
 After the perinatal period, females begin an attendance cycle in which
 they alternate 2 to 4 d foraging trips to sea with 1 to 2 d nursing visits
 ashore until the pup is weaned at about 11 months of age (Odell 1981, Heath
 1989, Antonelis et al.
 1990, Melin et al.
 2000).
 Breeding occurs about 3 to 4 weeks post-partum, beginning in late June
 and ending in early August.
 Males arrive at the colony in May but peak numbers occur in July at the
 peak of breeding.
 Only a small proportion of adult males establish breeding territories.
 Individual males may hold a territory from one day to two months.
 Non-breeding males haulout on beaches outside the main breeding areas.
 .
 Males disperse from the colony in early August and winter at hauling sites
 along the California, Oregon and Washington coasts, the islands of British
 Columbia, Canada and southeast Alaska.
 Juveniles and adult females haul out at SMI as well as hauling areas along
 the central California coast during the winter but lactating females must
 return regularly to the colony to nurse their pups.

Marking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From 1987 through 2007, we hot branded 3 to 5 month old California sea lion
 pups at Adams Cove on SMI (200 to 500 each year).
 We branded between 1{%} and 4{%} of the pups born annually.
 For 2 to 5 days, large groups of females and pups hauled out on the beach
 in Adams Cove were slowly herded so as to release the females and retain
 the pups for branding.
 Pups that were too small for branding or unhealthy were removed from the
 group.
 Although this resulted in a slightly biased sample of pups, typically fewer
 than a dozen pups (

) were rejected and we believe that the unhealthy pups were unlikely to
 survive and the stress of being held and branded might further compromise
 any chance of their survival.
 Starting in 1993, the sample sex ratio was skewed to provide a larger sample
 size for females to increase the precision of female survival estimates
 and to provide a larger sample size for natality estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pups were gathered and held in a large holding pen until they were branded
 and released.
 .
 Before branding, each pup was weighed to nearest 0.2 kg, sexed and tagged
 in the foreflippers with yellow roto-tags.
 The tags facilitated location of branded animals in large groups and provided
 a returnable identification for animals found dead on beaches or in nets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each pup was branded on the left shoulder (except for the 1987 cohort which
 was branded on the right shoulder) with a unique number and released.
 Branding techniques are described in Merrick et al.
 (1996).
 Hot brands destroy the hair follicles and pigment-producing cells in the
 epidermis, leaving a dark permanent mark that grows proportionally with
 the animal.
 Brands were completely healed within two months after application.
 Each brand digit was about 7.5 cm high and 4.0 cm wide at application.
 At adulthood, each digit was about 15.0 cm high and 8.0 cm wide.
 Brands of this size were easily observed from distances up to 600 m with
 binoculars or spotting scopes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\shape italic
Resighting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain accurate estimates of survival, sea lions of all age and sex classes
 needed to be resighted.
 Resighting all age and sex classes was complicated by the expansive range
 of sea lions (Figure 1).
 However, during the reproductive season, the range contracts primarily
 to the breeding islands and the central and northern California hauling
 sites.
 We focused the resight effort during this time to minimize the geographic
 areas that needed to be surveyed and to maximize the number of marked sea
 lions of each age and sex class that could be sighted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From 1990 through 2009, branded sea lions were resighted during the reproductive
 season at SMI.
 Observations were made from stationary blinds or from cliffs overlooking
 populated beaches.
 Because of the large number of areas that sea lions use on the island,
 all areas could not be surveyed every day.
 We divided the survey effort into two areas; Area 1 was surveyed daily
 every year and Area 2 was surveyed daily in some years but more commonly
 two to three times a week.
 Observers scanned areas repeatedly until clearly visible branded animals
 were identified.
 Branded animals were identified using binoculars or 20 to 45X zoom spotting
 scopes.
 For each observation of a branded animal, the date, area, reproductive
 status and brand number were recorded.
 Prior to 1994, observation effort was limited to SMI under the assumption
 that California sea lions would have fairly high fidelity to their natal
 site.
 However, a study in 1994 indicated that many juveniles were hauling out
 at Año Nuevo Island (ANI) (37.01°N, 122.3°W), during the reproductive season
 suggesting that observation effort only at SMI would not be adequate for
 juveniles.
 In 1996, ANI, the Farallon Islands (FAI) (37.7°N, 123.0°W) and haul-outs
 in Monterey Bay and along the Big Sur coast were surveyed during the reproducti
ve season (Figure 1).
 The more expansive effort demonstrated that most juveniles could be observed
 at SMI, ANI and to a lesser degree, FAI.
 Because of limited resources, we only added annual field sighting effort
 at ANI from 1996 to 2009 that included surveys two to three times a week
 between May and August.
 We also supported observation effort at the FAI during 1998 because we
 expected larger numbers of juveniles and adults to move further north during
 the El Niño event.
 We obtained opportunistic sightings from the FAI in other years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\series bold
Model Development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Annual survival rates (i.e, probability of surviving a year) were estimated
 from the release-resighting data of branded sea lions using the Cormack-Jolly-S
eber (CJS) model formulation.
 For CJS models, the initial capture and marking is a release event and
 only recaptures (resightings) of the marked individuals at later sampling
 occasions are treated as data.
 For our analysis, each year from 1987-2007 a branded cohort of pups was
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

released
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and surviving pups were sighted in the following years during the reproductive
 season.
 We used resights from 1990-2009 (no effort in 1987-1988) during 15 May
 to 15 August of each year as the sampling occasion because it encompasses
 pupping, breeding and post-breeding (when the structure of the rookery
 is more dynamic and mixed) periods.
 For CJS, sampling occasions are assumed to be instantaneous events such
 that there are no deaths during the sampling period.
 While observations obtained over a 3 month period are clearly not instantaneous
, we chose this period to balance the need to get an adequate sample size
 of all age and sex classes against the possibility of losses (deaths) during
 the period.
 In our analysis, we have assumed that all observed branded animals survive
 during the 3 month period and all mortality occurs between occasions.
 Annual survival for non-pups in year y represented 1 July of year y to
 1 July of year y+1.
 For pups, survival was for the time period from branding to 1 July of the
 following year.
 Branding occurred at different times so unequal time intervals (e.g.
 0.8 for 8 tenths of a year) were used for each pup survival year to represent
 them as annual rates .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most capture-recapture models assume that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are not lost and are recorded correctly.
 In comparison to flipper tags which are often used on pinnipeds, brands
 have the distinct advantage of being permanent and cannot be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 unless the brand is obscured (e.g., tar accumulation or bite scars) or illegible,
 which occurred infrequently in our study.
 However, brands can potentially be misread or recorded incorrectly which
 can bias survival estimates.
 Brand misreads are most problematic if a brand of a dead animal is incorrectly
 recorded as being seen and thus alive.
 To reduce the potential impact of brand misreading on the estimates, we
 defined a sighting of a branded sea lion to have occurred if it was seen
 at least twice (typically on different days) in the same year or it was
 photographed for verification.
 As long as errors occur independently, this will reduce the error rate
 substantially.
 In 2003 we began using field computers with an error checking program as
 part of the data entry process.
 After the brand was entered into the computer, the observer was notified
 if the brand number was for a sea lion that was known to be dead, the opposite
 sex, or if the sea lion had not been seen for 2 or more years (which is
 not necessarily an error but is uncommon for adult animals).
 When any of these conditions occurred, the observer checked the brand while
 in the field and corrected the brand number if an error was made.
 We have received reports of branded sea lions all along the U.S.
 west coast and occasionally in Mexico and Canada.
 However, in addition to the seasonal restriction, we restricted the analysis
 to sightings made on SMI, ANI and FAI where we had consistent sampling
 programs and personnel with sufficient experience to read and record brands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a sea lion to be sighted at some time after branding, it must survive
 until that time and it must be seen and have its brand read.
 Thus, the probability that a sea lion is sighted at some occasion following
 release is a function of the probability that it survives (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

), the parameter of interest, and the probability of sighting (
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

) and reading the brand of a surviving sea lion, a necessary but less interestin
g parameter.
 Survival and sighting probabilities can vary due to time, age, sex and
 various other reasons.
 A CJS model specification depends on survival (

\end_inset

 and sighting (

We examined 76 different models (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) for survival that included some combination of sex, age, year, pup weight,
 reproductive status, and temporal environmental and disease covariates.

: Sea lion age was specified as the number of years at their last birthday
 (specified as 1 July).
 Thus, pups were age 0, yearlings age 1, and so on.
 We used the following intervals for age: 0, 1, 2, 3-4, 5-7, 8-9, 10-11,
 12-14, and 15-21.
 We used these intervals to reduce the number of age-specific parameters
 and because they were relevant to sea lion life history.
 Sea lions less than 3 years old were not reproductive and we expected the
 greatest change in survival for juveniles so we estimated a separate 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 for ages 0, 1 and 2.
 Females may become reproductive at age 3 (rarely) or 4 and most are reproductiv
e by age 7 (Melin et.
 al.
 2012).
 Ages 8 to 21 were divided into four groups to examine changes in survival
 at older ages.
 The age intervals were wider for older animals because the sample size
 of live animals decreased with age.
 The age intervals were designed specifically for females but similar intervals
 applied to males which mature socially and sexually between 9 and 14 years
 old.
 Due to differences in their life history and behavior, we expected that
 survival pattern would differ for males and females.
 We also expected that any patterns across age would differ for the sexes,
 so we considered models that included interactions with sex (sex*age).
\end_layout

There was little resighting effort expended in 1988 and 1989, so we excluded
 those resighting occasions and set p=0 for those 2 years which precluded
 estimating year-specific survival from 1987, 1988 and 1989 for the 1987
 and 1988 cohorts.
 Thus, for each model we included four parameters for female and male survival
 from pup to age 3 (1990) for the 1987 cohort and from pup to age 2 for
 the 1988 cohort.
 For the remaining cohorts, survival could be estimated separately for each
 age.

: Pup weight affects post-weaning survival in other otariids (Baker and
 Fowler 1992; Hastings et al.
 2011) so we examined models in which pup weight affected pup survival.
 With the possibility of a carryover effect of pup weight, such that smaller
 pups have lower survival throughout their lives (Hastings et al.
 2011), we also examined models in which pup weight influenced the survival
 of yearlings and older animals by adding age-specific parameters until
 they no longer improved the fit.
 Given the short-time period between weaning and their first birthday (3
 to 4 months), it was very likely that smaller pups might survive a few
 months post-weaning and die as yearlings but any further carryover was
 possible but unlikely.
 The pup weight covariate (Weight) was measured as the deviation of the
 pup's weight from the sex-specific mean weight of all pups from 1989-2007.

:In terms of survival, reproduction is potentially costly for sea lions.
 For females, once they give birth, they produce a pup most years and sustain
 an energetically demanding cycle of lactation and gestation for much of
 their adult life.
 It may be potentially more costly for males who can be seriously or terminally
 hurt while engaging in territorial behaviors or may lose substantial weight
 while largely fasting during breeding.
 While age may encapsulate some variation in survival due to reproduction
 as they mature sexually, some sea lions, particularly males may never engage
 in breeding.
 Thus, we defined an individual time-varying covariate (Repro) that was
 initially 0.
 Once a female was seen either pregnant or with a pup, it was set and remained
 at 1 for survival probabilities after that occasion.
 Likewise, the covariate for males was set and remained at 1, if the male
 was seen engaging in territorial behavior.
 The impact of reproduction on survival may increase or decrease with age,
 so we also considered an individual time-varying covariate (RepAge) that
 measured the number of years since the sea lion was first seen reproductive.

:We expected that survival would vary by year due to natural variation in
 prey availability and oceanographic conditions such as the El Niño events
 in 1992-1993, 1997-1998 and 2002-2003.
 However, we did not expect that temporal variation would act equally across
 age classes.
 Instead, we expected more temporal variation in survival of younger sea
 lions and that our ability to detect temporal variation would decrease
 for older ages partially due to smaller sample sizes resulting from mortality.
 Thus, in posing alternative models, we fitted a sequence of models in which
 temporal variation was included for age 0, age 0 and 1, ages 0, 1, 2, etc.
 until there was no indication of a temporal signal in an age class.
 For older age classes that did not support separate annual survival probabiliti
es we evaluated models with annual survival varying as a linear function
 of environmental conditions, the greatest of these being the periodic occurrenc
e of El Niño events.
 El Niño events are characterized by changes in atmospheric-ocean circulation
 patterns and are described by a multi-variate El Niño Southern Oscillation
 index (MEI) measured at the equator (Wolter et al.
 1998).
 Because of changes in ocean circulation patterns, sea surface temperatures
 increase along the California coast and provide a locally based proxy for
 the strength and duration of the events as well as smaller scale perturbations
 in the California Current that affect sea lion prey availability.
 We know that El Niño events impact survival of sea lions (DeLong et al.
 1991,ADD CITATIONS) but the strength and duration of El Niño events determines
 the influence they have on survival so we evaluated two alternative covariates
 to capture differential effects of El Niño: 1) average sea surface temperature
 (SST) anomaly which was measured at five NOAA data buoys (NOAA National
 Data Buoy Center, http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov) located generally north of San
 Miguel Island in the female foraging area (Melin and DeLong 2000, Melin
 et al.
 2008), and 2) the MEI which we lagged by three months because it is measured
 at the equator and a three month lag provided the highest correlation with
 the local SST.
 For pups, we used the average from 1 October to 30 March and for non-pups
 we used the average from 1 July to 30 June to correspond to the survival
 periods.
 For MEI these were lagged by three months so they were actually the average
 from 1 April to 30 March of the following year.
 For pups and yearlings, we also examined models with a linear trend over
 time.

 Both are often the primary sex-specific cause for stranded sea lions.
 The number of sea lions (2 years and older) that stranded in central and

 We have excluded many of the simpler models that were clearly inferior.

\begin_layout Standard
We expected 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to vary by year because the level of survey effort varied.
 Beginning in 1990 directed re-sighting effort began in earnest but at a
 low level due to competing studies during the pupping/breeding season.
 In 1994, effort was increased to a level that yielded far more information
 and much higher sighting probabilities.
 The trend increased into the late 1990s but subsequently varied due to
 amount of available personnel.
 Also, a resighting program at ANI was initiated in 1994 and has been continued.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also expected that sighting probability would vary for females and males
 and it would differ across ages for each sex.
 We used the same age intervals for sighting probability except that we
 combined the last 4 age intervals (8+) because we did not expect much change
 once most had reached sexual maturity.
 Adult females spend more time at the island for birth, breeding and attendance
 to the pup; whereas, adult males are on the island primarily for breeding.
 Idle (non-territorial) males may spend far less time at the island or remain
 elsewhere.
 Juveniles do not participate in breeding and more often seen at ANI with
 a bias towards more males.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With shifts in survey coverage and protocol, we expected temporal variation
 in the sex- and age-specific resighting probabilities (ie.
 interaction of sex, age and time).
 Initially we presumed a high level of fidelity to the natal site (ADD ref
 to fur seals), so resighting effort at San Miguel was initially focused
 in the vicinity of East Adams Cove where pups were marked.
 As the population expanded we realized the presumption was not correct
 and also found that juveniles and non-territorial males were primarily
 using other portions of the island during the pupping/breeding season.
 We adjusted the sampling coverage across the island which made it more
 likely that juvenile sea lions and non-territorial males would be sighted
 during the later years of the study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We divided San Miguel into 2 areas (Melin et al in press) to cope with individua
l fidelity to specific areas that received unequal sampling coverage.
 Area 1 was the vicinity around Adams cove which received the most resighting
 effort.
 Area 2 was the remainder of the island which received a lower level of
 effort initially but increased over time.
 We defined a third area which included ANI and any opportunistic sightings
 from FAI.
 We defined an individual sea lion covariate for areas 1 and 2 which varied
 over time.
 The covariate for Area 1 was initially 0 at release but was set and remained
 at 1 for years after a sea lion was seen in Area 1.
 Likewise, the covariate for Area 2 was initially 0 and was set and remained
 at 1 for ensuing years unless it was then seen in Area 1.
 Sea lions never seen or only seen in Area 3 retained a value of 0 for both
 covariates.
 Both Area 1 and Area 2 covariates were considered in models with parameters
 that varied by age and sex and also by time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With resighting surveys being conducted during the pupping/breeding season,
 we would higher resighting probabilities for pupping females and territorial
 males.
 While age may account for some of this variation, there is age-variation
 in recruitment (Melin et al.
 in press) and some sea lions, particularly males, may never participate
 in breeding.
 As with survival, we used a time-varying individual reproductive covariate
 (Repro) for resighting probability that was initially 0 but was set and
 remained at 1 for all years after being seen with a pup for females or
 demonstrating territoriality for males.
 We expected the affect of this covariate to differ for males and females
 so we estimated separate parameters for each sex.
 We also considered models in which the effect varied across time due to
 the impact of El Niño events on reproduction, pup mortality and attendance
 at SMI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have excluded many of the simpler models that were clearly inferior.
 While we expected variation across time, sex and ages, we found that it
 was necessary to limit fitting 3-way interactions to data collected in
 1994 and beyond, due to paucity of data prior to that year.
 We found that many estimates of p would end up at boundaries (0 or 1) if
 we attempted to fit interactions for data prior to 1994.
 So we segmented the model fitting at 1994.
 For data prior to 1994 we fitted sex and age interactions but an additive
 effect for time.
 For data from 1994 and later we fitted the more complex three-way interaction
 of time-age-sex with the additional covariates of reproduction and area.
 There were few observations of reproductive sea lions prior to 1993 and
 the sampling was almost exclusively in Area 1 prior to 1994, so limiting
 these to 1994 and beyond would have little impact.

Model Fitting

\begin_layout Standard
Our intial analysis of these data were conducted with the computer software
 MARK (White and Burnham 1990;

).
 However, we found that as we added individual time-varying covariates and
 created more complex models, the time needed to fit a single model in MARK
 made the analysis no longer feasible in reasonable amount of time.
 MARK creates a single design matrix and for individual covariates it substitute
s the values of covariates for each animal and computes the parameters for
 each animal.
 When you have thousands of animals as we did and there are many individual
 time-varying covariates, apparently the overhead of computing the design
 matrix for each animal for each iteration in maximizing the likelihood
 becomes extreme.
 Also, with MARK there was no capacity for varying unequal time intervals
 for each pup release cohort in MARK except to use the log link which only
 bounds the probabilities to be non-zero.
 Thus, we developed an R (R Core Development Team 2008) package to fit CJS
 models.
 The package is called marked and is described in more detail by Johnson
 et al (in press).
 A single complete design matrix is created and used for all iterations
 in maximizing the likelihood.
 This approach was first considered in the R package mra written by Trent
 McDonald (ADD REFERENCE).
 The design matrix is complete because it contains a row in the design matrix
 for each occasion for each animal, so it can easily handle individual time-vary
ing covariates.
 It would be equivalent to computing the design matrix in MARK for each
 individual and then binding them together.
 Clearly, this can be a relatively large matrix and required the use of
 sparse matrices which are available in the R package Matrix (ADD REFERENCE).
 Prior to adopting the marked package for this analysis, we fitted numerous
 models with marked and MARK to make sure that they were giving the same
 results.
 For more details about marked which also has capabilities for Bayesian
 analysis of CJS models, see Johnson et al.
 (in press).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would be remiss if we did not say that our individual time-varying covariates
 could have been handled possibly better with multi-state models in MARK
 but with the size of our analysis, we found it was also unreasonable, if
 we also included individual covariates like pup weight.
 Also, the existing multi-state analysis in MARK would still not have addressed
 the problem with unequal time intervals which varied across pup cohorts
 and differed from non-pups which were for an entire year.

 the median c-hat approach does not allow individual covariates.
 We restricted the analysis to the 1993-2007 cohorts which used most of
 the data and avoided the missing data for the 1988 and 1989 occasions and
 the low resight probabilities prior to 1994.
 We used the estimated

 Roughly one-half of the sightings at ANI and FAI were sea lions between
 1 and 3 years of age; whereas, only one-quarter of the sightings at SMI
 were between 1 and 3 years of age.

 ANI and FAI and females were more likely than males to be seen at SMI (Figure

 Resighting probability increased with age for females until age 8 or 9
 when most females were reproductive and then it remained relatively constant
 for the older ages (Figure 4).
 For males, resighting probability increased until age 12, the mean age
 of territorial males.
 The resighting probability for males was generally lower than for females.
 The average resighting probability of all age groups of males and females
 increased from a low near 0.10 in 1991 to over 0.60 in the late 1990s and
 then it remained relatively constant (Figure 5).
 The large increase in 1994 was associated with initiation of a dedicated
 resight effort at ANI and the increase in 1997 reflects an increase in
 effort and expansion of regular surveys to cover beaches on SMI beyond
 the Point Bennett rookery.

 In those models with a domoic acid effect for both sexes (e.g., model 3 in

 Consequently the model-averaged estimates of survival for males reflected
 very little impact from variation in domoic acid cases.
 For example, to control for the impact of leptospirosis, we can compare
 the survival rates in 2001 and 2002 when the number of DA cases were 315

In contrast to adult survival, pups and yearlings demonstrated sufficient
 annual variation in survival to support separate annual estimates (Figure

 Pup and yearling survival were severely depressed in 1997 during the strong
 El Niño event and to a much lesser degree during the weaker 1992 and 2003
 El Niño events.
 In addition, pups born during an El Niño had lower survival the following
 year as yearlings.
 This was most apparent in 1998 when pup survival was high but survival
 of yearlings from the 1997 pup cohort was nearly as low as survival of
 the yearlings from the 1996 cohort that were weaned during the 1997 El
 Niño.
 The same pattern occurred, but to a lesser degree, in 1993 after the 1992
 El Niño event.
 The pattern was not observed after the 2003 El Niño event which was much

\begin_layout Standard
Our mark-recapture study of branded California sea lions at San Miguel Island
 produced precise estimates of age and sex-specific survivorship for the
 population.
 Our study shows the importance of longitudinal studies of long-lived animals
 to understanding the drivers of population trends.
 Similar to other large mammals, we determined that survival of pups and
 yearlings was the most dynamic component of the population and it is these
 two age groups that are the drivers of the population dynamics.
 Once animals reached 2 years old, they had fairly high survival until they
 reached 15 years or older.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term nature of the dataset allowed us to investigate environmental
 factors that influenced survival of different age and sex groups.
 El Niño affected principally the survival of pups and yearlings, outbreaks
 of leptosporosis disease affected survival of sub-adult and adult males,
 and outbreaks of domoic acid poisoning affected adult females.
 In addition, the lower survival of pups from 2000 to 2004 coincides with
 significant mortality attributed to hookworm disease in the population
 suggesting that disease signals may be detected in all age and sex groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a long-lived polygynous species, it is expected that age and sex-specific
 survival rates will vary for males and females (references).
 We found that male sea lions had lower survival rates than females in all
 age groups except pups and yearlings.
 Males must attain a large size to successfully compete for territories
 and access to breeding females and so require greater resources for survival
 compared to females of the same ages.
 The mean age of territorial males is 12 years and we observed a decline
 in survival of males in the 11
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 age groups that may be related to the cost of reproduction.
 Adult males fight and fast for days to weeks or months while holding territorie
s () and the energetic drain of such activities may reduce their survival..
 But we also found evidence for lower survival of sub-adult and adult males
 during outbreaks of leptospirosis disease indicating that the effects of
 disease on survival, even on a small scale, can be detected when the precision
 of the survival estimates is high.
 Female pinnipeds may also incur a cost to survival from reproduction (Testa
 and Siniff, Boyd et al.
 1995).
 The peak reproductive ages for California sea lion females are between
 8 and 10 years (Melin 2002, Hernández-Camacho et al.
 2008) but some females remain reproductive until at least 25 years of age
 (Hernández-Camacho et al.

 years) in our study tended to decline with age suggesting that female sea
 lions may incur a survival cost for reproducing.
 We also found weak evidence of lower survival of adult females during domoic
 acid events demonstrating that environmental covariate data can further
 describe the trends in survival.
 The sex-specific effects of leptospirosis disease and domoic acid poisoning
 are likely related to the winter distribution of the age groups most susceptibl
e to the diseases.
 Adult and sub-adult males migrate northward from the colonies in the fall
 when the leptospirosis outbreaks generally occur whereas juveniles and
 females remain in central California.
 Similarly, domoic acid outbreaks tend to occur in central California and
 mostly affect adult females.
 Thus the susceptibility to these two factors of mortality appears to be
 linked to sex-specific behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike adults, the survival rates of male and female pups and yearlings
 were similar suggesting that mortality factors acting on these age groups,
 such as disease and El Niño, are not sex-specific.
 These age groups showed the greatest annual variability in survival which
 was mostly explained by El Niño events.
 El Niño events result from global changes in oceanographic and atmospheric
 patterns that temporarily alter the dynamics of marine ecosystems for a
 period of one to two years.
 In the California Current, El Niño events cause an increase in sea surface
 height, an increase in sea surface temperatures, and a depressed thermocline
 and nutricline (Arntz et al.
 1991).
 These oceanographic changes temporarily reduce primary and secondary productivi
ty and the abundance and availability prey of California sea lions.
 Females have difficulty provisioning their pups and the result is high
 mortality of pups from starvation.
 The pups that survive are weaned at lower weights compromising their survival
 as yearlings, when they are learning to feed independently in an environment
 with reduced food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are few studies of sea lion or fur seal species that have estimated
 age-specific survival using mark-resighting data over the lifetime of the
 animals.
 Survival rates from collections of fur seals (
\shape italic
Arctocephalus
\shape default
 spp.) indicate that our female pup and adult female survival rates are similar
 to species with similar life histories (9-11 month lactation period) which
 range between 0.889 and 0.953 for adult females and between 0.452 and 0.828
 for first year survival of females (Wickens and York 1997, Beaupaulet et
 al.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to Hernández-Camacho et al.
 (2008), we found that survival rates of California sea lions decline as
 they get older, suggesting that senescence occurs in California sea lions.
 In general, our age-specific survival rates were similar for males but
 lower for females than those reported for sea lions in the Gulf of California.
 Both studies found no sex effect for pups but sex-specific differences
 were apparent among juveniles and adults groups.
 Our study differentiated yearlings from juveniles and we found no sex effect
 for yearlings.
 El Niño did not appear to have a significant effect on survival of pups
 in the Gulf of California, which is counter to our findings in which pups
 born or weaned during El Niño conditions had significantly lower survival
 rates than their age groups in other years.
 The Gulf of California and San Miguel Island colonies inhabit very different
 environments and the differences between the two studies likely reflect
 a combination of true differences between the populations and sample size
 effects.
 Hernández-Camacho et al.
 (2008) had relatively small samples from a small number of cohorts compared
 to our study.
 The number of cohorts and the time period in which the marking and resighting
 occurs can greatly influence the outcome of the models.
 For example, if we had only sampled 5 cohorts between 2000 and 2004 our
 survival rates for pups would have been lower than the survival rate that
 we obtained from our larger sample of 18 cohorts.
 The larger number of cohorts allowed us to estimate separate survival rates
 for a greater number of age groups and to detect differences in survival
 due to several environmental factors, providing more insight into which
 factors contribute most to the population dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the 19 years of this study, the design evolved as we learned about
 the behavior of sea lions.
 We increased the sighting effort, increased the number of surveyed areas,
 and skewed sample sizes toward females to increase the precision of survival
 estimates of the most critical component of the population.
 These changes to the resighting effort increased the resighting probabilities
 of all the age groups and both sexes and, consequently, the precision of
 the survival estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equally important as the design of the resighting effort is the reliability
 of the marking technique.
 Brands provided a permanent mark that was easily read at long distances
 with no disturbance to the colony.
 Between 1975 and 1986 various methods of tagging California sea lions were
 undertaken (DeLong, unpublished data) but yielded little resight data because
 of tag loss, tag unreadability, and the inability to approach animals to
 read tag numbers without disrupting the colony and the animal of interest.
 With branded animals, we had a reliable permanent mark and were able to
 achieve resighting probabilities as high as 85

 which is not common in most mark-recapture studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the central assumptions to mark-recapture studies is that marks are
 not lost, overlooked or misread.
 Although brands cannot be lost, they must be read and recorded correctly
 and this process is prone to error.
 We attempted to minimize the error by defining a sighting event to have
 occurred if the sea lion was sighted 2 or more times in a year.
 This restriction on a sighting event should have reduced or eliminated
 most reading or recording errors unless a brand was consistently misread
 due to poor brand quality.
 However, this definition of a sighting event also introduced heterogeneity
 in the resighting probability because those sea lions that were hauled-out
 less frequently or hauled-out in areas that were surveyed less frequently
 would have a reduced chance of being sighted relative to sea lions that
 hauled-out more often or in areas frequently observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is likely that the remaining heterogeneity is due to behavior that we
 currently have not or that cannot be modeled.
 For example, over the years of the study, we received and made sightings
 of branded animals from San Nicolas Island, a colony about the size of
 San Miguel Island and located approximately 60 km southeast of San Miguel.
 Adult females with pups have been sighted in multiple years at San Nicolas
 Island indicating a small level of emigration is occurring.
 These animals may occasionally be observed at San Miguel Island when hauled-out
 but may not be regularly observed, introducing heterogeneity into the resightin
g probability.
 Other examples of behaviors that may introduce heterogeneity into the resightin
g probabilities include nursing cycles of females and territorial behavior
 of males.
 Females with a nighttime nursing pattern may not be observed as frequently
 as females that nurse their pups during the daytime, and males that have
 water territories are more likely to be observed during the low tide than
 during the high tide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term nature of our dataset shows the importance of the number of
 cohorts, the number of marked animals in each cohort, and the number of
 years of resighting effort to accurately describe age and sex-specific
 survival patterns in a long-lived pinniped.
 We branded about 200 animals annually during the first three years of the
 study compared to 500 animals branded annually in the remaining years.
 Increasing the sample size of branded animals resulted in greater precision
 in estimating survival of the older ages and sample sizes of 300 or greater
 appear to be sufficient to estimate survival rates of this colony.
 The effect of sample size on precision of the survival estimates is best
 represented by comparing the standard errors of the 15
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 age group represented by cohorts of 200 or fewer animals and those of the
 11-14 year age group represented by cohorts of 500 animals.
 The standard error is 3 to 4 times greater for the 15
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 age group due to the low number of animals alive in this age group.
 As more of the larger cohorts reach the 15
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 age group the precision of the survival estimates should improve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on long-lived species requires long-term studies and while we have
 not yet followed a cohort through their life cycle, we have begun to develop
 a fairly complete picture of survival in California sea lions.
 That picture shows age and sex specific differences in survival with senescence
 for older animals but the dominant dynamic is the large annual variations
 in survival associated with El Niño oceanographic events.
 During the last several decades, El Niño events have played a central role
 in the population dynamics of California sea lions through lower survival
 of pups and yearlings and lower natality rates of adult females (DeLong
 et al.
 1991, DeLong and Melin 2000, Melin 2002).

 However, trend data for pup production and mortality indicates that the
 dynamics of this population may be different from the other colonies.
 While the survival rates presented here are precise and can be used in
 demographic models for the species, it must be noted that they represent
 rates from a large, increasing population and may not be reflective of
 populations with different trajectories or environmental stressors as evidenced
 by the differences between survival rates of sea lions in the Gulf of Californi
a, Mexico and San Miguel Island.

Decscription of alternative models for survival probability of branded Californi
a sea lion resighting data.
 Age is the age bins used for survival (0,1,2,3-4,5-7,8-9,10-11,12-14,15-22).
 Year (time) was applied to all ages(.) or separately for each age listed
 (P-pup,Y-Yearling, 2- age 2, and 2+ or 3+ for ages 2 and older or 3 and
 older).
 Likewise, pup weight was used as a covariate for pup survival (P) and seprately
 to yearling (Y) or 2 year old (2) survival when listed.
 Lepto was used only for 2+ male survival and DA for 2+ female survival.
 SSTA is the sea surface temperature anomaly averaged over the July 1 to
 following June 30 and this was used for 2+ survival.
 Likewise, MEI is the multivariate El Nino index and it was averaged over
 April 1 to following March 30 so as to lag its effects 3 months.
 It was also applied only to 2+ survival.
 Sex:MEI allows for a separate relationship for males which spend most of
 the year from Northern California to Repro is 1 for sea lions previously
 seen reproductive and RepAge is the number of years since they were first
 seen as reproductive.
 Each model contained 4 parameters for estimation of female and male 0 to
 3 and 0 to 2 year survival for the 1987 and 1998 cohorts respectively.
 Models 61-75 were the same as 46-60 except SSTA was used in place of MEI
 for pups and yearlings.

Description of nine alternative models for re-sighting probability of branded
 California sea lion resighting data.
 Models 2-9 had separate models fitted for data prior to 1994 and 1994 and
 afterward when there was more resighting effort.
 A numeric entry in the cell refers to a prior model specification with
 the possible addition of more covariates.
 For example, 2+ sex*repro for model 3 refers to prior model plus the addition
 of the reproductive covariate (repro) interaction with sex.
 The covariate repro is 1 if the sea lion was reproductive in a prior year
 and 0 otherwise.
 Likewise, Area 1 and Area 2 are the time varying covariates as described
 in the Methods.
 The covariate age refers to the age bins for p (ages 1,2,3-4,5-7,8+).
 For models 2-8, 11 parameters in the model were used for data prior to
 1994 and the remainder were for the other occasions.
